# Spec-Kit: Review Constitution

Review the project constitution at `docs/spec-kit/templates/constitution-template.md`.

Ensure all current work aligns with:
- **Core Principles**: Compliance First, OCA Standards, Security & Data Governance, Quality & Testing, Multi-Agency Coordination
- **BIR Compliance Requirements**: Immutable fields, audit requirements, validation rules
- **OCA Module Standards**: Module structure, naming conventions, code quality
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, scalability, monitoring
- **Development Workflow**: Spec-driven process, quality gates

If updating constitution, ensure team approval before changing.

## Current Constitution Status
The constitution defines non-negotiable rules for:
1. Financial data handling and BIR compliance
2. OCA module development standards
3. Security and data governance
4. Performance and scalability targets
5. Spec-driven development workflow

## Key Constraints
- No coding without approved specification
- All BIR forms must maintain audit trail
- Financial data is immutable once posted
- Test coverage ≥80% for financial modules
- Code review required before merge

Review the full constitution and confirm alignment before proceeding with any development work.
