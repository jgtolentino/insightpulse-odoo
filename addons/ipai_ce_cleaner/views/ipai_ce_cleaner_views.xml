        Placeholder for CE/IAP cleanup.

        Here you will later:
        - Inherit settings and app views to hide "Upgrade to Enterprise" banners.
        - Remove any menus that open IAP or odoo.com flows.
        - Replace doc/support links with InsightPulse/OCA URLs.

        Keep it empty for now so the module installs cleanly.
