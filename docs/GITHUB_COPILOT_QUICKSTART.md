## Best Practices for Odoo Development

### ✅ DO

```python
# Use descriptive comments for better suggestions
# Create an Odoo expense report model with approval workflow
class ExpenseReport(models.Model):
    _name = 'expense.report'
    # Copilot will suggest relevant fields
```

- Use Copilot for boilerplate (models, views, tests)
- Review all suggestions before accepting
- Run linters and tests after using Copilot
- Check license compatibility for cited code

### ❌ DON'T

- Don't commit Copilot-suggested API keys or secrets
- Don't blindly accept suggestions without review
- Don't skip OCA compliance checks
- Don't ignore security scanning results

---

## Security

### What's Excluded (`.copilotignore`)

Already configured to exclude:
- `.env*` files and secrets
- Credentials and keys (`.pem`, `.key`)
- Large datasets and backups
- Build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`)
- Vendor dependencies

### Review Suggestions For

- 🔒 Hardcoded credentials
- 📜 License compatibility (we use LGPL-3.0)
- 🛡️ Security vulnerabilities
- ✅ OCA compliance
- 🇵🇭 BIR regulation adherence

## Troubleshooting

### No Suggestions Appearing

1. Check Copilot icon (bottom-right in VS Code)
2. Sign in: `GitHub Copilot: Sign in`
3. Check access: `GitHub Copilot: View Status`
4. Restart IDE

### Access Denied

1. Verify org membership
2. Contact admin to assign seat
3. Wait 10 minutes for propagation

### Poor Suggestions

1. Add more context in comments
2. Use descriptive names
3. Add type hints
4. Reference Odoo docs in comments
