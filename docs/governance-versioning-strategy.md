## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning Format
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.YYYYMMDD
```

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (Odoo version compatibility)
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, security patches
- **YYYYMMDD**: Build date for tracking

### Version Control Rules
1. **Odoo Version Compatibility**: All modules target Odoo 19.0
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Minor and patch versions maintain compatibility
3. **Release Cadence**: Monthly releases with hotfixes as needed
4. **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency declarations in manifests

## Governance Framework

### Module Lifecycle

#### 1. Development Phase
- Module creation with proper manifest structure
- Domain metadata configuration
- Security access control setup
- View and model implementation

#### 2. Testing Phase
- Unit testing for models and business logic
- Integration testing with Odoo core
- Security testing for access controls
- Performance testing for large datasets

#### 3. Deployment Phase
- Automated deployment scripts
- Database migration handling
- Configuration validation
- Health monitoring setup

#### 4. Maintenance Phase
- Regular security updates
- Performance optimization
- Feature enhancements
- Bug fixes and patches

### Quality Standards

#### Code Quality
- PEP 8 compliance for Python code
- XML validation for views and data
- Proper error handling and logging
- Comprehensive documentation

#### Security Standards
- Principle of least privilege for access controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure credential management
- Regular security audits

#### Performance Standards
- Efficient database queries
- Proper indexing strategy
- Caching implementation where appropriate
- Resource optimization

## Domain-Based Architecture

### Module Categorization
- **Administration**: System management and configuration
- **Connectors**: External system integrations
- **Analytics**: Business intelligence and reporting
- **Workflow**: Process automation and business logic

### Domain Metadata
Each module includes domain-specific metadata:
- Website URLs for documentation
- Category classification
- Summary descriptions
- Author and licensing information

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Environment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper backup strategy
- **Application**: Odoo 19.0 with custom addons path
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics

### Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secure credential storage
- Version-controlled deployment scripts
- Automated testing and validation

## Compliance and Security
