### 2. Specialized Sub-Agent Delegation

**Agent Deployment Matrix**:

| Agent | Worktree | Artifacts Created | Execution Time |
|-------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **DevOps** | `infra/superset/` | DO App Platform spec, deployment automation | Phase 1 |
| **Backend** | `config/superset/` | Production config, Supabase integration | Phase 1 |
| **Docker** | `docker/superset/` | Production Dockerfile, entrypoint script | Phase 1 |
| **Security** | `security/superset/` | Secrets template, security hardening | Phase 1 |
| **Network** | `deploy/superset/` | Traefik config, path routing | Phase 2 |
| **Documentation** | `docs/superset/` | Deployment guides, READMEs | Phase 3 |

### 3. MCP Integration

**MCP Servers Used**:
