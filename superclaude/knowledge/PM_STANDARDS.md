#### Risk Analysis
- **Qualitative**: Probability/Impact matrix
- **Quantitative**: Monte Carlo simulation, decision tree analysis
- **Prioritization**: Risk score = Probability Ã— Impact

#### Risk Response Strategies
- **Avoid**: Eliminate threat or protect from impact
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Shift to third party (insurance, contracts)
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor
- **Exploit**: Ensure opportunity occurs
- **Enhance**: Increase probability or impact of opportunity
- **Share**: Allocate ownership to third party
- **Accept**: Do not pursue opportunity
